# fister
Chrome extension to alert the user of feminist propaganda

# How it works
When you visit any web page, the plugin searches the page's text for common feminist terminology. 
If any is found, the feminist fist will show up in the address bar.

# OKCupid
As a bonus for singles, _fister_ saves you valuable time when looking at profiles. If the profile
contains feminist terminology, a huge feminism fist will be applied to the background.
